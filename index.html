    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <div>
        <span class="npm">npm start</span>
        <p>Runs the app in the development mode.<br>Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to view it in your browser.</p>
        <p>The page will reload when you make changes.<br>You may also see any lint errors in the console.</p>

        <span class="npm">npm test</span>
        <p>Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>See the section about <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/">running tests</a> for more information.</p>

        <span class="npm">npm run build</span>
        <p>Builds the app for production to the <span style="background-color:grey; padding:2px;border-radius: 5px;">build</span> folder.<br>It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.</p>
        <p>The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>Your app is ready to be deployed!</p>
        <p>See the section about <a href="https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/">deployment</a> for more information.</p>

        <span class="npm">npm run eject</span><br>
        <span style="font-size: 16px;">Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you <span style="background-color:grey; padding:2px;border-radius: 5px;">eject</span>, you can't go back!</span>
        <p>Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.</p>
        <p>You don't have to ever use <span style="background-color:grey; padding:2px;border-radius: 5px;">eject</span>. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.</p>
